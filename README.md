# Alfred

A free and open source cross-platform **audio synthesizer**, **sequencer** and **composition editor** program.

It comprises a software multi-timbral synthesizer using additive and wavetable methods, and an interface to compose and play music.

It is same instrument + pitch monophonic, otherwise it supports up to twelve voices simultaneously.

The synthesized sounds are meant to be *suggestions* and *hints*, rather than realistic emulations.

I built this program for myself, as a reason to try out the art of music composition. Of course, MuseScore already exists, but isn't it nice to make your own tooling?

Read the manual [here](MANUAL.md).

Alfred is split into two:

- A synthesizer library worrying about synthesis-related things almost exclusively
- A sequencer and composition editor GUI application which enables playing notes and editing music, and which loosely models some sheet music concepts

Currently, Alfred is in its infancy, so its current instruments are not well-made, and it is still missing some important features, which will probably be addressed with time:

- Plugins which dynamically add compiled instruments/presets
- A graphical way to create, store and load runtime instruments/presets
- Support for MIDI keyboard controllers
- ~~Presenting errors nicely instead of just silently logging them~~

Alfred works with 16-bit samples, one channel, and frequency of 44100 Hz.

## Building, Installing and Packaging

Alfred was at least built and tested on:

- Fedora Linux 43, GNOME 49, Wayland, PipeWire, GCC 15.2, CMake 3.31
- Ubuntu 25.04, GNOME 48, Wayland (Xwayland), PipeWire, GCC 14.2, CMake 3.31
- Windows 11 25H2, WASAPI, MSVC 19.50, CMake 4.3

Additionally, it was at least tested on:

- Linux Mint 22.3, Cinnamon 6.6, X11, PipeWire

Alfred is solely 64-bit software.

Build in distribution/release mode for the best audio experience! Compiled without optimizations, due to low performance, the audio output can sometimes sound glitchy and bad!

*Distribution* mode means compiling without assertions, without additional debug code and generally for system integration. It differs from release mode, which merely means compiling with optimization flags enabled.
